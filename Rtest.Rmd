This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
require(tidyverse)
require(forecast)

cons <- as.matrix(Icecream$cons) 
colnames(cons) <- "x"
temp <- as.matrix(Icecream$temp)
colnames(temp) <- "x"

fit_cons_temp <- auto.arima(cons, xreg = temp)
fcast_temp <- as.matrix(c(70.5, 66, 60.5, 45.5, 36, 28))
colnames(fcast_temp) <- "x"
fcast_cons_temp <- forecast(fit_cons_temp, xreg = fcast_temp)
autoplot(fcast_cons_temp)

```
